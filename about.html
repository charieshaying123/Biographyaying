            <p>Childhood experiences - Back when I was just eight years old, my world changed forever. My  father passed away, leaving a void in our family that could never truly be filled. My mother, strong and determined, had no choice but to work tirelessly to provide for us. It was during this time that my grandparents became more than just family; they became my second set of parents, my protectors, and my guiding light.
                <br>
                <br>
             Every morning, my grandmother would wake me up with a gentle touch, her wrinkled hands warm with love. The aroma of freshly cooked rice and warm soup would fill our home, a simple yet comforting reminder that I was cared for. She taught me kindness, patience, and the value of resilience.
                <br>
                <br>
             My grandfather, on the other hand, was my silent guardian. He wasn’t a man of many words, but his actions spoke volumes. He would walk me to school, holding my hand firmly yet gently, ensuring that I was safe. On weekends, we would sit outside under the old mango tree, where he would tell me stories of his youth, of struggles and victories, of love and loss. Through his tales, I learned the strength of family and the importance of never giving up.
